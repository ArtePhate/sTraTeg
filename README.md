1 once enjoyed playing board games that used hexagonal grid maps and unit counters and whilst looking through a Raspberrypi I've come across a link the inimicable Invent With Python Making Games With Python and Pygame. Using elements of that books I thought it would be fun to try to learn a little modern python by developing some things (objects, tools, apis) for making hexagonal maps and other forms of game objects in pygame.
